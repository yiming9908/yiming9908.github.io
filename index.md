I am a M.S. Quant student at [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://umich.edu/). I also got a M.S. Stats from [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). Before that, I obtain my B.S. in Mathematics from [UNNC](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/index.aspx).

## Research Interests

- **Stochastic Analysis & SDEs:** stochastic processes, diffusion models, covariance/Kernel structure, stability and estimation
- **Optimization & Inverse Problems:** convex optimization, sparsity/regularization (e.g., Lasso-type methods), high-dimensional statistics
- **Quantitative Finance Applications:** risk measures (e.g., CVaR), portfolio optimization, derivatives pricing/hedging, data-driven modeling
